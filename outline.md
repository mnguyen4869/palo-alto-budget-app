Project Outline: FinTech Financial Visibility App
## Frontend (Web App)
Technology: React.js (using Vite)

Justification:

Rapid Prototyping: Vite provides an extremely fast development server and build process, which is a massive advantage in a time-constrained hackathon.

Rich Ecosystem & Reusability: React's component-based architecture allows you to build the UI in modular, reusable pieces. You can leverage powerful, pre-built UI libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design to create a professional-looking interface quickly.

Powerful Data Visualization: To address the "Financial Visibility" success metric, you can easily integrate robust charting libraries like Recharts or Chart.js to build the required dashboards and spending breakdowns.

Seamless API Integration: React is designed to work perfectly with REST APIs, making it straightforward to fetch and display data from the new FastAPI backend.

Plaid Web Support: Plaid's Plaid Link module is a pre-built React component that can be dropped directly into your application, securely handling the entire bank connection flow.

## Backend (Server & API)
Technology: Python with FastAPI

Justification:

Performance: FastAPI is built on ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) and is one of the fastest Python web frameworks, capable of handling a large number of concurrent requests.

Data Science Synergy: By using Python, you can natively leverage libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and others directly in your API code without needing a separate microservice. This simplifies the architecture and reduces complexity.

Automatic Documentation: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation with Swagger UI, which is invaluable for a hackathon setting. This makes it easy to test endpoints and collaborate with frontend developers.

Type Safety: FastAPI enforces type hints using Pydantic, which helps prevent common data-related bugs and makes the API easier to use and maintain.

## Database
Technology: SQLite

Justification:

Zero-Configuration: SQLite is a serverless, file-based database. This eliminates the need for a separate database server, saving significant setup time.

Simplicity & Speed: It's built into Python's standard library and is incredibly fast for local development and prototyping, which aligns perfectly with a hackathon's velocity requirements.

No Network Latency: All database operations are handled directly on the local file system, removing any network latency that would be introduced by a separate database server.

## API & Authentication
Plaid API: Continue to use the Plaid API for secure access to user financial data.

Authentication: Implement a secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and OAuth2 with FastAPI. This is a standard and secure method for managing user sessions and protecting API endpoints.

## Core Logic (AI & Analytics)
Technology: Python Libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn)

Justification:

Pandas: A powerful and flexible library for data manipulation and analysis. It's perfect for ingesting, cleaning, and manipulating the transaction data pulled from Plaid.

Scikit-learn: A comprehensive library for implementing the core AI features like anomaly detection and forecasting.

Task Implementation: Use Scikit-learn for IsolationForest to identify spending anomalies, classification models to refine transaction categories, and rule-based methods to detect subscriptions and "Gray Charges."

## Deployment
Technology: Render

Justification:

Simplicity and Speed: Render is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) provider that allows you to deploy your application with a simple git push.

Free Tiers: It offers a generous free tier that is more than sufficient for a hackathon prototype.

Add-ons: Render can easily handle both the FastAPI backend and a simple file-based SQLite database.

Polyglot Support: Render can host both the Python/FastAPI backend and the React frontend, making it a one-stop shop for your deployment needs.
