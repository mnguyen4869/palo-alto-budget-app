# Hackathon Case Study: Smart Financial Coach ðŸ’°

## Problem Statement:
Many people struggle with personal finance due to a lack of visibility
and personalized, actionable advice. Manually tracking every expense is tedious, and generic
budgeting apps often fail to inspire lasting behavioral change. As a result, people are often
unaware of wasteful spending habits, miss opportunities to save, and feel anxious about their
financial future.

## Your Challenge:
Design a smart financial coach that uses AI to transform raw transaction
data into personalized insights that empower users to take control of their financial lives.

## Target Audience:
- Young adults and students looking to build good financial habits.
- Freelancers and gig workers with variable incomes who need help with budgeting and
saving.
- Anyone looking to gain a clear understanding of their spending and find actionable ways
to save more effectively.

## Example Features as Inspiration (Feel free to define your own):
- Intelligent Spending Insights: The tool securely connects to a user's bank accounts and
goes beyond simple categorization. It uses AI to identify trends and anomalies, sending
friendly insights like, "You've spent $120 on coffee this month. Brewing at home could
save you over $1,000 a year!"
- Personalized Goal Forecasting: A user sets a financial goal (e.g., "Save $3,000 for a
down payment in 10 months"). The AI analyzes their spending and income to forecast if
they are on track. If not, it provides specific, non-judgmental suggestions on where they
can cut back to reach their goal.
- Subscription & "Gray Charge" Detector: The AI scans transaction history to identify all
recurring subscriptions, forgotten free trials that have converted to paid services, and
other "gray charges." It presents them in a single list, allowing the user to easily identify
and cancel unwanted services.

## Success Metrics:
- Behavioral Change: Does the app provide insights that lead to measurable changes in
user spending or saving habits?
- Financial Visibility: How effectively does the dashboard help users understand exactly
where their money is going?
- Trust and Security: Does the application's design and communication feel secure and
trustworthy for handling sensitive financial data?
- AI Application: How well does the solution leverage machine learning for anomaly
detection, forecasting, and personalization?
Submission Requirements:
- Working Prototype/Demo: A functional application demonstrating your chosen
features.
- Presentation (5-7 minutes): A concise video covering the problem, your solution, a live
demo, and key learnings.
- Design Documentation: An outline of your design, tech stack, and future
enhancements.
